                <ul>
                    <li>Claude AI is a generative-AI chatbot and language model developed by Anthropic.</li>
                    <li>It's built on large-language-model (LLM) and “transformer” architecture: given a prompt (text, and in many cases even files or images), it generates what it predicts to be the most appropriate response.</li>
                    <li>Importantly, Claude is designed with a safety/ethics framework. Its responses are guided by a set of principles (sometimes referred to as “constitutional AI”) that aim to reduce harmful, biased or toxic outputs.</li>
